# CompressedLUT
Lookup tables are widely used in hardware applications to store arrays of constant values. They can be directly used to evaluate nonlinear functions or used as a part of other approximate methods (e.g., piecewise linear approximation and bipartite tables) to compute such functions. CompressedLUT is a tool for lossless compression of lookup tables and generation of their hardware files in Verilog and C++ for RTL and HLS designs. 

CompressedLUT has been developed as a part of the following publication. Please refer to it for more information.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiabuzz/CompressedLUT.git
cd CompressedLUT
make
```
    
## Getting Started
This tool works in two modes: you can either (1) specify  a  text  file  that contains the values of a lookup table, or (2) describe a math function by providing its equation.

#### 1. Lookup Table as a Text File
In this mode, you need to prepare a text (.txt) file, containing the values of your lookup table. The file must contain a power of 2 lines, each of which is a single hexadecimal value. An example of such a text file can be found in example.txt. The following command generates hardware files corresponding to the lookup table described in that text file.

```bash
./compressedlut -table example.txt
```

#### 2. Lookup Table as a Math Equation
In this mode, you need to specify a math function by providing its equation and fixed-point quantization parameters. The following command is an example of this mode.

```bash
./compressedlut -function "exp(x-1)" -f_in 10 -f_out 12
```

The command above generates hardware files for implementing the math function exp(x-1). The function is evaluated in [0, 1) using 10 fractional bits for the input and 12 fractional bits for the output. The signedness and bit width of the integer part in the output are determined automatically. To evaluate this function in ranges other than [0, 1), you can modify the equation by scaling and shifting the input variable x.

It is worth noting that you can use your customized script to evaluate a math function, then store its output values in a text file, and finally compress and implement it using CompressedLUT in the first mode.

See the help.txt file for command line arguments in more detail.

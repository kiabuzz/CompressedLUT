Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This program generates source code  for  univariate  functions.  It 
works in two modes: you can either (1) specify  a  text  file  that 
contains the values of a lookup table specifying  f(x)  for  all  x 
values, or (2) describe the function by providing its equation.

1) Lookup table as a text File -->  Please  specify  the  following 
   arguments:
	-table (string)		: path of  the  table,   in   which 
	                          each   line    has    a    single   
	                          hexadecimal value. The table size 
	                          must be a power of 2.  The  input
	                          and   output   bit   width    are 
	                          determined  based  on  the  table 
	                          size  and  the  maximum  absolute    
	                          value of the table, respectively.
	
2) Lookup table as a math equation --> Please specify the following 
   arguments:
	-function (string)	: function's    equation    as    a 
	                          string in quotation marks "".
	-f_in (int)		: fractional  bit  width   of   the 
                                  function's   input.   Since   the 
                                  function is evaluated in  [0, 1),
                                  there are  no  integer  bits  for 
                                  the input.
	-f_out (int)		: fractional  bit  width   of   the 
	                          function's output. The signedness 
	                          and  integer  bit  width  of  the 
	                          output       are       determined 
	                          automatically.

The following optional arguments can be used in either mode.
	-name (string)		: output table and file name.
	-output (string)	: output folder for  the  generated
	                          files. The  folder  must  already 
	                          exist.                     
	-mdbw (int)		: minimum decomposition bit  width. 
	                          The default value is 2. 
	-hbs (0/1)		: higher-bit  split.  The   default 
	                          value is 1 (0=no, 1=yes). 
	-ssc (0/1)		: self-similarity compression.  The 
	                          default value is 1. 
	-mlc (0/1)		: multi-level   compression.    The 
	                          default value is 1.

This program generates source code  for  univariate  functions.  It 
works in two modes: you can either (1) specify  a  .txt  file  that 
contains the values of a look-up table specifying f(x)  for  all  x 
values, or (2) describe the function by providing its equation.

1) Lookup table as .txt  File  -->  Please  specify  the  following 
   arguments:
	-table (string)		: the path of the table,  in  which 
	                          each line has a  single   integer  
	                          value.  The  table  size must  be 
	                          a power of 2. 
	
2) Function equation --> Please specify the following arguments:
	-function (string)	: the  function's  equation  as   a 
	                          string in quotation marks "".
	-f_in (int)		: fractional  bit  width   of   the 
                                  function's   input.   Since   the 
                                  function is evaluated in  [0, 1),
                                  there are  no  integer  bits  for 
                                  the input.
	-f_out (int)		: fractional  bit  width   of   the 
	                          function's  output.  The   output 
	                          integer bit width  is  determined 
	                          automatically.


The following optional arguments can be used in either mode.
	-name (string)		: output  table   and   file   name
	-output (string)	: the   output   folder   for   the 
	                          generated files. The folder  must
	                          already exist.
	-mdbw (int)		: minimum decomposition bit  width. 
	                          The default value is 2. 
	-hbs (0/1)		: higher-bit  split.  The   default 
	                          value is 1 (0=no, 1=yes). 
	-ssc (0/1)		: self-similarity compression.  The 
	                          default value is 1. 
	-mlc (0/1)		: multi-level   compression.    The 
	                          default value is 1.
